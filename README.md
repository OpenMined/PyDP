# PyDP

In today's data-driven world, where data analytics is used by the Researchers or Data Scientists to create better models or innovative solutions for a better future! They often tend to handle sensitive or personal data, which brings in some privacy concerns. For example, sometimes, AI models can memorize details about the data they've trained on and could 'leak' these details later on. Differential privacy is a framework (using math) for measuring this leakage and reducing the possibility of it happening. 

This is where PyDP comes in. PyDP is a Python wrapper for Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) project. The library provides a set of Îµ-differentially private algorithms, which can be used to produce aggregate statistics over numeric data sets containing private or sensitive information. Thus, helping us achieve better privacy.

**Things to remember about PyDP :**
- :rocket: Features Differentially Private Algorithmic functions as part of the 0.1.1 dev release, added to carrots demo such as BoundedMean, BoundedSum, Max, Count Above, Percentile, Min, Median , etc.  
- All the computation methods mentioned above, use Laplace noise only. (Other noise mechanisms will be added soon... :smiley:)
- :fire: Currently supports Linux and OSX. (Windows coming real soon... :smiley:)
- :star: Supports all the Python 3+ versions.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install PyDP.

```bash
pip install python-dp
```

## Usage
Refer to [this example](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/tree/dev/examples) to understand PyDP library usage.

For usage via code explanation, refer to [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/1.1%20-%20Introductions%20to%20PyDP.ipynb) or [Python file](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/carrots.py) for carrot demo.

A sample of usage can be found below:

```
import pydp as dp # imports the DP library

# To calculate the Bounded Mean
# epsilon is a number between 0 and 1 denoting privacy threshold
# It measures the acceptable loss of privacy (with 0 meaning no loss is acceptable)
# If both the lower and upper bounds are specified, 
# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double, lower: int, upper: int)
x = dp.BoundedMean(0.6, 1, 10)

# If lower and upper bounds are not specified, 
# DP library automatically calculates these bounds
# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double)
x = dp.BoundedMean(0.6)

# To get the result
# Currently supported data types are integer and float. Future versions will support additional data types
# Refer to examples/carrots.py for an introduction
x.result(input_data: list)

```

## Start Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project please read these [guidelines](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/contributing.md).

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

***Note : Known issue -***  If the privacy budget (epsilon is too less), we get a StatusOR error in the command line. While this needs to be raised as an error, right now, it's just displayed as an error in logs.
