# Introduction

PyDP is a Python wrapper for Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) project. The library provides a set of Îµ-differentially private algorithms, which can be used to produce aggregate statistics over numeric data sets containing private or sensitive information.

PyDP is part of the OpenMined community, come join the movement on [Slack](http://slack.openmined.org/).
