## About PyDP

The project uses [Pybind11](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io) to wrap Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) library. 
The library is written in C++, so it is best you have some familiarity with that language before attempting to help out here. 

You can check out [here](https://www.learncpp.com/) to get your started about C++.

Regarding Pybind, Here is a good [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQedHfF1Jfw) about it.

## Setting up your environment

Two installation scripts are available to help get your environment ready set up:
- ext_source_setup - This clones Google's differential privacy library as well as some other third party dependencies.
- prereqs - This script automates the installation of the prerequisite packages to get you started, you can optionally install these manually referring to the list below.

It is worth noting that whilst you can absolutely set up a Windows environment, it is a lot simpler to get started with Linux. For Windows 10 users, we'd highly recommend the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and the very handly [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension for VS Code.

## Pre-requisites

Nothing in particular, prereqs takes care of everything.
