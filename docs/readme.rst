Introduction to PyDP
====================

In today's data-driven world, more and more researchers and data
scientists use machine learning to create better models or more innovative
solutions for a better future.

These models often tend to handle sensitive or personal data, which
can cause privacy issues. For example, some AI models can memorize details about the data they've been trained on and could potentially leak these
details later on.

To help measure sensitive data leakage and reduce the possibility of
it happening, there is a mathematical framework called differential
privacy.

In 2020, OpenMined created a Python wrapper for Google's `Differential
Privacy <https://github.com/google/differential-privacy>`_ project
called PyDP. The library provides a set of Îµ-differentially private algorithms,
which can be used to produce aggregate statistics over numeric data sets containing
private or sensitive information. Therefore, with PyDP you can control the
privacy guarantee and accuracy of your model written in Python.

**Things to remember about PyDP:**

-  ::rocket: Features differentially private algorithms including: BoundedMean, BoundedSum, Max, Count Above, Percentile, Min, Median, etc.

  -  All the computation methods mentioned above use Laplace noise only (other noise mechanisms will be added soon! :smiley:).

-  ::fire: Currently supports Linux and macOS (Windows support coming soon :smiley:)
-  ::star: Use Python 3.6 and above. Support for Python 3.5 is being deprecated.

Installation
------------

To install PyDP, use the `PiPy <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__
package manager:

.. code:: bash

    pip install python-dp

(If you have ``pip3`` separately for Python 3.x, use ``pip3 install python-dp``.)

Examples
--------

Refer to the `curated list <https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/tree/dev/examples>`__ of tutorials and sample code to learn more about the PyDP library.

You can also get started with `an introduction to
PyDP <https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/carrots_demo/carrots_demo.ipynb>`__ (a Jupyter notebook) and `the carrots demo <https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/carrots_demo/carrots.py>`__ (a Python file).

Example: calculate the Bounded Mean

.. code:: python

    # Import PyDP
    import pydp as dp
    # Import the Bounded Mean algorithm
    from pydp.algorithms.laplacian import BoundedMean

    # Calculate the Bounded Mean
    # Structure: `BoundedMean(epsilon: double, lower: int, upper: int)`
    # `epsilon`: a Double, between 0 and 1, denoting the privacy threshold,
    #            measures the acceptable loss of privacy (with 0 meaning no loss is acceptable)
    # `lower` and `upper`: Integers, representing lower and upper bounds, respectively
    x = BoundedMean(0.6, 1, 10)

    # If the lower and upper bounds are not specified,
    # PyDP automatically calculates these bounds
    # x = BoundedMean(epsilon: double)
    x = BoundedMean(0.6)

    # Calculate the result
    # Currently supported data types are integers and floats
    # Future versions will support additional data types
    # (Refer to https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/carrots.py)
    x.quick_result(input_data: list)
