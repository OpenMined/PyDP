#### Laplace Demo

### How Privacy and Noise are related to each other:

This section of the jupyter notebook describes about Privacy is implented in data by adding noise to it so that the attacker won't be able to known the final result and by what 
degree the actual result is close to anonymized data.

### A brief description about Exponential Distribution:

The next section of the notebook describes the meaning of exponential distribution and provides a visual example for better understanding.

### Laplace Distribution:

An example of a simple Laplace distribution has been provided here. In addition to it the section also describes how the mathematical form of Laplace looks and how each 
parameter plays a part in preserving privacy.

### Why should you use Laplace:

This section tells us why should you use Laplace and how well it works with Îµ.

### Conclusion:

A recap of everything you have learnt in this notebook.
