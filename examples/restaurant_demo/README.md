### Day-wise data(day_data.csv):

### Week-wise data(week_data.csv):

This file contains the same columns as the day_data.csv but here the information has been generated for an entire week.

### Restaurant.py:

We implement PyDP algorithms on the daily and weekly datasets of the restaurants by aggregating different results and comparing results with and without privacy preserving
preserving techniques and show to the effectiveness of PyDP here. The algorithms which have been implemented here are BoundedSum and Count of the Laplacian packages of PyDP. 
At first we import all the necessary libraries and then assume some constants and write respective functions for number of visitors per hour per day , revenue per day etc 
with and without privatisation of data and then compare them against each other to find the difference in results.
